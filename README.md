🌊 Venice Water Memory — Digital Heritage Project

Author: Berk Ateşalp
Project Type: Interactive Cultural Heritage Map + AI Narrator
Frameworks: React, Leaflet, OpenAI API, Europeana XML, OAI-PMH

🏛️ Project Overview

The Venice Water Memory project reimagines Venice’s relationship with water as a digital heritage archive and storytelling platform.
Each canal, well, or lagoon site becomes both a metadata record and a living narrative, linking tangible geography with intangible memory.

Through this approach, the project bridges:

Cultural heritage documentation (archival accuracy)

Digital storytelling (AI-generated micro-narratives)

Open data interoperability (Europeana and UNESCO Water Heritage standards)

🗺️ Core Features

🗃️ Interactive Water Map — Each point on the Venice map represents a historical water site (craft, faith, trade, ritual, infrastructure).

💧 Archival Metadata — Every location includes metadata structured according to the Dublin Core standard.

🤖 AI Water Narrator — An AI component generates poetic, site-specific stories, blending memory and imagination.

💾 Data Export Options:

JSON → for research and data analysis

Europeana XML → archival / cultural heritage compatibility

OAI-PMH XML → metadata harvesting for digital repositories

🧠 Technology Stack
Layer	Tools & Libraries	Purpose
Frontend	React.js, Leaflet.js, Framer Motion	Interactive map and UI animation
Data	Custom JSON dataset (waterStories.js)	Heritage site metadata
AI	OpenAI GPT-4o API	Narrative generation
Archival	Europeana XML, OAI-PMH protocol	Metadata export & archival compliance
Audio	Ambient water soundscape	Immersive environment
🗂️ Archival & Metadata Standards

The dataset follows the Dublin Core model (ISO 15836), ensuring interoperability across Europeana and UNESCO systems.

Key Fields:
dc:title, dc:creator, dc:subject, dc:description,
dc:date, dc:type, dc:coverage, dc:rights, dc:language

Supported Formats:

JSON (Technical Dataset) — developer-friendly structure

Europeana XML (Archival Format) — compliant with Europeana Data Model (EDM)

OAI-PMH XML (Harvestable Protocol) — compatible with Open Archives Initiative

These export functions allow the Water Memory dataset to act as a data provider for digital heritage infrastructures.

🌐 AI Narrative Layer

Each archival item contains:

Structured metadata (historical accuracy)

AI-generated narration (interpretive storytelling)

This dual structure transforms the project from a static database into a “living archive” — a system where code and culture coexist, and every dataset becomes an act of storytelling.

🔭 Future Development

🌊 Integration with Europeana Metis Sandbox for ingestion testing

🪶 Persistent identifier (DOI) registration via Zenodo

🧭 Expansion to new collections: Venetian Trade Routes, Lagoon Ecosystems, Water Festivals

🗣️ Optional AI voice synthesis for spoken narration (TTS)

💬 Project Statement

“Water has memory — not only in its reflections, but in the crafts, rituals, and voices that once flowed through Venice.
This project reawakens those traces, merging historical archives with digital intelligence,
so that the lagoon itself can speak again.”
